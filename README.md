# greasemonkey-scripts
This repository contains any user scripts I write for greasemonkey.

To use a script, install Tampermonkey for your browser. (Firefox can also use greasemonkey)  
Then, simply click on a raw url below, and If you have installed the Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey plugin properly, a verification should ask if you want to install.
